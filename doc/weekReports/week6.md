# 6. Week report

## What have I done

Started to implement own datastructures. MyList datastructure has been made and I will start to implement MyHashMap and MyHeap datastructures.

## Progress off an aplication

Algorithms work, but they will be changed to work with my own datastructures.

## Learned things

Basic idea how to start to implement MyHashMap datastruct.

## Unclear things

How to implement the MyHeap datastructure that it works with algorithms.

## Next to-do

MyHashMap and MyHeap data structures. Also start to work with more usable UI. There should also be an option to use LZW -algorithm.
