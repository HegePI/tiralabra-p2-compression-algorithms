# 5. Week report

## What have I done

Implemented the [encode](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/compressionAlgorithms/LZW.java#L49) and [decode](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/compressionAlgorithms/LZW.java#L82) parts of LZW algorithm. FileReaderWriter also [saves](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/compressionAlgorithms/FileReaderWriter.java#L154) compress to a file and [reads](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/compressionAlgorithms/FileReaderWriter.java#L144) it from there.

## Progress off an aplication

LZW algorithm works and saves the compress to file.

## Learned things

Decode part of algorithm.

## Unclear things

---

## Next to-do

Start to replace already made data structures with my own implementations.
