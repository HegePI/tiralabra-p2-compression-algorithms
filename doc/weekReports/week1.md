# 1. Week report

## What have I done

I have decided to implement Huffman and LZW compression algorithms. I have read literature about these algorithms and familiarized myself into them.

## Progress aff an aplication

Project layout created.

## Learned things

Basic methodology of Huffman and LZW algorithms.

## Unclear things

Final/most efficient implementation of algorithms.

## Next to-do

To implement algorithms to an application as fast as possible by using already made datastructuresd (list, priority queue, etc...). After this it's easier to specify different datastructures that will be needed and to start the implementation of these datastructures by myself.
