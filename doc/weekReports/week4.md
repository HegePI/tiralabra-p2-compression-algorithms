# 3. Week report

## What have I done

Red, how LZW -algorithm works and how to implement it. Started to implement the [encode](https://github.com/HegePI/tiralabra-p2-compression-algorithms/pull/5/files#diff-8dc65f7a2c0b3e206153b213451f2a5c59db19b158a9a678fd344f24f6d8a305R19) part of a algorithm.

## Progress off an aplication

Started to implement LZW -algorithm.

## Learned things

Basic functionality of a LZW -algorithm.

## Unclear things

---

## Next to-do

Continue with LZW, especially start to code the decode part of an algorithm.
